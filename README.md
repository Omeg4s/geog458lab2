# geog458lab2
This repository includes several different image files and a jupyter notebook that utilizes a webcrawler for specifically collecting tweets over designated geographical areas. Specifically in this repository, I have used the webcrawler to collect geotagged tweets across areas in California (the bay area and more south including San Francisco and Los Angeles) as well as Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan Areas (the area around Milwaukee). I chose these areas for this lab due to the current day NBA playoffs that are happening with the teams of the Golden State Warriors, Chicago Bulls, and the Milwaukee Bucks. I want to compare how the tweets differ between similar geographical areas where basketball playoffs are in full swing. The webcrawler takes these geotagged tweets and puts them into csv format with their latitude and longitude as well as the actual text of the tweet. Using this information and a mapping program called QGIS, I created two maps (for each geographical area) that shows the distributions of these tweets over a basemap of the area described above. Addtionally, using the text from the tweets, I made two word maps that analyze the count of each word used over all the tweets and creates art where the more a word is used the bigger it will appear. These two different analysis on the geographical areas allows for viewers to see where the tweets are coming from and what the tweets are talking about it creative and cool ways.
## Below is the two maps that are also uploaded to the repository
### Wisconsin

### California

As mentioned earlier, these two maps are of different geographical areas, where one is of California and the area specifically around the Golden State Warriors stadium in San Francisco while the other is of Milwaukee and Chicago and the area specifically around the Milwaukee Bucks and Chicago Bulls. It is interesting to observe the different geospatial patterns between the two areas because in California, there is obvious clustering of the tweets around the two large cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles while in the Wisconsin area, it seems to be not as concentrated. This could be due to the vastly different population densities of the two areas. California has much more people densely packed into the big cities while Wisconsin has more real estate where people can have more land to themselves. These trends are mirrored in the distribution of the tweets.
## Below is the two wordarts that are also uploaded to the repository

It seems as though even if they are two different geographical locations across the country, they still share some similar tweet language and words. Specifically looking at words like "out", "look", and "today", these three words are present in both wordarts, and must be common place words no matter where you are. One obeservation of difference, however, is the notable presence of the words "love" and "beach" in the California one. Could this be attributed to the geographical area where the are surrounded by nice beaches and hot weather? These different contexts can only be because of where these tweets are located and it is fascinating to see how peoples mindsets differ by location.
