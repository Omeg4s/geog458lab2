# geog458lab2
This repository includes several different image files and a jupyter notebook that utilizes a webcrawler for specifically collecting tweets over designated geographical areas. Specifically in this repository, I have used the webcrawler to collect geotagged tweets across areas in California (the bay area and more south including San Francisco and Los Angeles) as well as Wisconsin and Michigan Areas (the area around Milwaukee). I chose these areas for this lab due to the current day NBA playoffs that are happening with the teams of the Golden State Warriors and the Milwaukee Bucks. The webcrawler takes these tweets and puts them into csv format with their latitude and longitude as well as the actual text of the tweet. Using this information and a mapping program called QGIS, I created two maps (for each geographical area) that shows the distributions of these tweets over a basemap of the area described above. Addtionally, using the text from the tweets, I made two word maps that analyze the count of each word used over all the tweets and creates art where the more a word is used the bigger it will appear. These two different analysis on the geographical areas allows for viewers to see where the tweets are coming from and what the tweets are talking about it creative and cool ways.
